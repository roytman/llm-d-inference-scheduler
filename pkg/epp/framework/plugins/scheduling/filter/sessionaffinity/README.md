# Session Affinity Filter

**Type:** `session-affinity-filter`
**Interfaces:** `scheduling.Filter`
**Category:** Hard affinity

Pins each session to the endpoint that served its previous request. When the session is bound to one of the current candidates, every other candidate is removed; otherwise all candidates pass through.

## What it does

For each request the filter reads the `BoundEndpoint` attribute published by a `session-id-producer`:

- **Binding present, endpoint in candidates**: returns only that endpoint.
- **Binding present, endpoint not in candidates** (e.g. the endpoint was scaled down): returns all candidates unchanged so other plugins can select a replacement.
- **Binding absent** (no session, or session not yet bound): returns all candidates unchanged.
- **Single candidate in list**: always returns it unchanged, skipping the lookup.

## How it works

The `session-id-producer` keeps an in-memory, time-expiring map of session identifier to endpoint. Pre-schedule it publishes the bound endpoint on the request as `BoundEndpoint`. Post-schedule it records the endpoint chosen by the primary profile so the next request in the same session can be steered back. The filter only reads.

## Inputs consumed

- `BoundEndpoint` attribute, published by `session-id-producer`.

## Configuration

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `sessionIDProducerName` | `string` | No | `""` (uses default producer) | Name of the `session-id-producer` instance whose `BoundEndpoint` this filter consumes. |

### Example

```yaml
plugins:
  - type: session-id-producer
    parameters:
      headerName: x-session-id

  - type: session-affinity-filter

schedulingProfiles:
  - name: default
    plugins:
      - pluginRef: session-affinity-filter
```

## Difference from session-affinity-scorer

Both plugins consume the same `BoundEndpoint` attribute but differ in how strictly they enforce stickiness:

| | `session-affinity-filter` | `session-affinity-scorer` |
|---|---|---|
| **Guarantee** | Hard, only the bound endpoint is returned when present | Soft, bound endpoint gets the highest score, others remain |
| **On endpoint unavailability** | Falls back to the full candidate set | Other scorers determine the winner |

Use the filter when strict stickiness is required for correctness. Use the scorer when a best-effort preference is sufficient and other scorers should still get a vote. Configuring both at once is redundant: the filter dominates the scorer in every case, so the extra scoring work changes no outcomes.
